# Tic-Tac-Toe Project

Here is a link to my game.  https://atsundwn.github.io/ttt-project/

This is my attempt at creating a tic-tac-toe game.

I wrote html to create the various elements including title, game board, and output window.

To style and position the elements I created a separate css file and linked to it on the html file.

I created a javascript file for the game logic and behavior.  For DOM manipulation, I used jQuery which I also linked to on the html file.

I used API provided by Antony to use AJAX to talk to the backend.  I loaded  Antony's code before mine so the methods and variables were available in my file.  I also included forms from Antony's code on my html.

I was able to login and create a new game and also markCell method works so the game state is being saved by the server.
